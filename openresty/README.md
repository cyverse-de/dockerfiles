OpenResty
=========

This image is based on the openresty/openresty:centos image. It only exists as a
way to allow us to manage exactly which version and build of openresty we're
using.

`/usr/local/openresty/` contains the openresty install.

`/usr/local/openresty/nginx/` contains the nginx files for the openresty install.

`/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` is the path to the nginx
configuation file.
