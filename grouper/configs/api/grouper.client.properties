# The grouper client uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from grouper.client.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the grouper.client.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the grouper.client.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the grouper.client.properties

# Look for overlay configuration files in the classpath and /etc/grouper/.
grouperClient.config.hierarchy = classpath:grouper.base.properties,classpath:grouper.properties,file:/etc/grouper/client.properties
